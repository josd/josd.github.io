We compare four safety tests for 2×2 complex system matrices with respect to
a gain limit G_max = 1:
  world 0: true spectral norm (||A||₂) via eigenvalues of A* A,
  world 1: Frobenius norm bound (||A||_F ≤ 1 ⇒ safe),
  world 2: column-length heuristic (max column norm ≤ 1 ⇒ safe),
  world 3: max-entry heuristic (max |a_ij| ≤ 1 ⇒ safe),
and two theorem-names:
  CorrectSafetyTest:  world w's 'safe' predicate agrees with the true one,
  NoFalseSafe:        world w never declares an unsafe matrix safe.
In engineering terms, world 0 corresponds to the ideal spectral-gain check,
world 1 is a conservative upper bound, and worlds 2 and 3 are cheap but
potentially dangerous shortcuts.

Empirical results (random tests over small complex matrices):

world | test description                 | Correct (ok/total) | NoFalseSafe (ok/total)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0    | true spectral norm (ground truth) | 200/200                 | 1/1
1    | Frobenius norm bound (conservative) | 200/201                 | 1/1
2    | column-length heuristic          | 200/201                 | 1/2
3    | max-entry heuristic              | 200/201                 | 1/3

Heuristically, we expect: world 0 (true spectral norm) to satisfy both CorrectSafetyTest and NoFalseSafe; world 1 (Frobenius bound) to satisfy NoFalseSafe but not CorrectSafetyTest; worlds 2 and 3 (column-length and max-entry heuristics) to fail both properties due to false safe decisions.

Holds₁ view on theorem-names:
  world 0: Holds1(thm:CorrectSafetyTest, 0)=True, Holds1(thm:NoFalseSafe, 0)=True
  world 1: Holds1(thm:CorrectSafetyTest, 1)=False, Holds1(thm:NoFalseSafe, 1)=True
  world 2: Holds1(thm:CorrectSafetyTest, 2)=False, Holds1(thm:NoFalseSafe, 2)=False
  world 3: Holds1(thm:CorrectSafetyTest, 3)=False, Holds1(thm:NoFalseSafe, 3)=False

Reason why
----------
In the first-order core, we represent 2×2 complex matrices as pairs of
Python complex numbers. We compute the operator 2-norm ||A||₂ by forming
the Gram matrix A* A, which is 2×2 Hermitian, and then taking the square
root of its largest eigenvalue. This gives an exact worst-case gain for
the linear map u ↦ A u under Euclidean norms. The true safety predicate
safe_true(A) requires ||A||₂ ≤ 1.

Each world defines a simpler or restricted safety test safe_world(w, A):
  • world 0 uses safe_true itself;
  • world 1 uses the inequality ||A||₂ ≤ ||A||_F and insists ||A||_F ≤ 1,
    which is conservative but can reject safe matrices;
  • world 2 tests only the lengths of the columns, ignoring combinations
    of columns that can produce larger gains (e.g. two equal columns give
    a spectral norm of sqrt(2) even though each column has norm 1);
  • world 3 tests only the largest individual entry, ignoring how entries
    cooperate to amplify certain directions.

We test two meta-properties over many random matrices and some deliberate
examples: CorrectSafetyTest (no mismatches with safe_true) and NoFalseSafe
(no unsafe matrix ever declared safe). From the results we build an
extensional model:
  • worlds: w ∈ {0,1,2,3},
  • theorem-names: thm:CorrectSafetyTest, thm:NoFalseSafe,
  • EXT1[thm:CorrectSafetyTest] = { w | safe_world(w,·) matches safe_true on all samples },
  • EXT1[thm:NoFalseSafe]       = { w | safe_world(w,·) has no observed false-safe decisions }.

We interpret Holds₁(P, w) as membership of w in EXT1[P]. At the binary
level, we set EXT2[rel:stronger] = { (thm:CorrectSafetyTest,
thm:NoFalseSafe) } and define Holds₂ by membership in EXT2. This captures
the idea that a fully correct safety test is stronger than a merely
one-sided (no false safe) test: in any world where CorrectSafetyTest holds
(here, world 0), NoFalseSafe holds as well. The logical layer is thus a
thin wrapper over the concrete numerical behaviour of different gain
tests, turning a very practical question—“Is this 2×2 complex system safe
under my gain limit?”—into a clean higher-order-looking story.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: spectral_norm behaves as expected and is ≤ Frobenius norm on tested matrices.
PASS 2: World 0 safety classification matches true safety on explicit examples.
PASS 3: World 1 is strictly more conservative than world 0 (Frobenius bound).
PASS 4: Worlds 2 and 3 have clear false-safe matrices.
PASS 5: Statistics match the intended pattern across all worlds.
PASS 6: Holds₁/EXT1 are consistent and CorrectSafetyTest is stronger than NoFalseSafe.
All checks passed.
