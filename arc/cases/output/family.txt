Model
=====
People         = [Frans, Jo, Paul, Pieter-Jan, Tim, Bert, Bart, Maria, Maaike, Rita, Goedele, Veerle, Ann, Veer]
MALE           = [Bart, Bert, Frans, Jo, Paul, Pieter-Jan, Tim]
FEMALE         = [Ann, Goedele, Maaike, Maria, Rita, Veer, Veerle]
Base parent    = [('Frans', 'Jo'), ('Frans', 'Rita'), ('Jo', 'Goedele'), ('Jo', 'Veerle'), ('Maaike', 'Goedele'), ('Maaike', 'Veerle'), ('Maria', 'Jo'), ('Maria', 'Rita'), ('Paul', 'Ann'), ('Paul', 'Bart'), ('Rita', 'Ann'), ('Rita', 'Bart')]
Base+sym spouse= [('Ann', 'Bert'), ('Bart', 'Veer'), ('Bert', 'Ann'), ('Frans', 'Maria'), ('Goedele', 'Pieter-Jan'), ('Jo', 'Maaike'), ('Maaike', 'Jo'), ('Maria', 'Frans'), ('Paul', 'Rita'), ('Pieter-Jan', 'Goedele'), ('Rita', 'Paul'), ('Tim', 'Veerle'), ('Veer', 'Bart'), ('Veerle', 'Tim')]

Question
========
Q1) children('Rita')
Q2) siblings('Veerle')
Q3) uncles('Veerle')
Q4) aunts('Bart')
Q5) father('Goedele'), mother('Goedele')

Answer
======
children('Rita')      -> [Ann, Bart]
siblings('Veerle')    -> [Goedele]
uncles('Veerle')      -> [Paul]
aunts('Bart')         -> [Maaike]
father('Goedele')     -> 'Jo'
mother('Goedele')     -> 'Maaike'

Reason why
==========
• Intensions are the *names* for relations and people (e.g., 'parent', 'Frans').
  Extensions are plain sets of pairs; application is just membership in those sets.
  Conceptually, Holds₂(parent, Frans, Jo) is implemented as ('Frans','Jo') ∈ parent.
• spouse is made symmetric by a small closure: if spouse(x,y) then spouse(y,x).
• siblings(x,y) is defined via a shared parent; the API hides the (x,x) cases.
• brother/sister, father/mother, grandfather/grandmother are gender-specialised
  views of sibling/parent/grandparent using the MALE/FEMALE sets.
• uncle and aunt are the least fixpoint of:
    – blood: a male/female sibling of a parent (x ≠ parent),
    – by marriage: spouse of an uncle/aunt.
  Direct parents are filtered out in the uncles()/aunts() helpers to avoid
  misclassifying a parent as their own child's uncle/aunt.
• No generic engine or unification is used; the whole model is computed
  by specialized closures over a finite universe, with semantics that match
  the rules.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: children('Rita') == ['Ann', 'Bart'].
PASS 2: siblings('Veerle') == ['Goedele'].
PASS 3: uncles('Veerle') == ['Paul'].
PASS 4: father/mother of Goedele are Jo/Maaike.
PASS 5: aunts('Bart') == ['Maaike'].
PASS 6: Parents are not exposed as uncles/aunts of their own children.
PASS 7: Spouse relation is symmetric.
PASS 8: Sibling relation is symmetric (including self-pairs).
PASS 9: brother/sister are specialisations of sibling.
PASS 10: grandfather/grandmother specialise grandparent.
PASS 11: Nobody is their own uncle/aunt.
PASS 12: Model closure is stable under rebuild.
