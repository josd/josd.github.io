Hessenberg’s theorem (1905): In any projective plane, if Pappus’ theorem holds for all appropriate configurations (i.e., the plane is Pappian), then Desargues’ theorem also holds for all configurations (i.e., the plane is Desarguesian).

Empirical check in finite projective planes PG(2, p):

p  | Pappus (ok/total) | Desargues (ok/total)
---------------------------------------------
3  | 120/120           | 120/120
5  | 120/120           | 120/120
7  | 120/120           | 120/120
11 | 120/120           | 120/120

Note: PG(2, p) over a field GF(p) is known to satisfy both Pappus and Desargues exactly; the statistics above should therefore show 100% success.

Reason why
----------
Modern algebraic perspective (very compressed):
  (1) A Pappian projective plane can be coordinatized by a commutative division ring, i.e. a field.
  (2) Projective planes over any division ring (commutative or not) satisfy Desargues.
  (3) Every field is a division ring.
  (4) Hence, in field planes, Pappus ⇒ Desargues.

Hessenberg’s synthetic route (outline, no coordinates):
  • Work in a projective plane where Pappus holds. Study central collineations (elations and homologies: collineations fixing an 'axis' line pointwise and a 'center' point).
  • Using Pappus, show that compositions of suitable elations behave like translations on an affine patch; these translations commute, giving a commutative 'addition' on each affine line.
  • Still synthetically, construct 'dilations' (homotheties) from a chosen triangle and central perspectivities. Their composition rules, controlled by Pappus configurations, provide a scalar-like multiplication.
  • This additive and multiplicative structure behaves like that of a field; the plane’s collineation group begins to look like the usual affine/projective group over a field.
  • In this setting, if two triangles are perspective from a point O, one can synthetically construct a perspectivity with axis ℓ taking one triangle to the other, forcing the intersections of corresponding sides to lie on ℓ. This is exactly Desargues’ theorem.
  • Thus Pappus, via the behavior of central collineations, enforces the Desargues property without explicit coordinatization.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: Basic projective primitives (line_through/dot) behave as expected.
PASS 2: Pappus holds in sampled configurations in PG(2, 3).
PASS 3: Desargues holds in sampled configurations in PG(2, 3).
PASS 4: All nondegenerate sampled configurations satisfy Pappus and Desargues.
PASS 5: Holds₁/EXT1 match the empirical theorem statistics for each world.
PASS 6: The Holds₂-level implication Pappus ⇒ Desargues matches all worlds.
All checks passed.
