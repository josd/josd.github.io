Target observations:
  carbon-chemistry, culture, galaxies, language, life, many-minds, mind.

Search explored 8846 distinct law-sets (nodes).
Found 129 consistent endpoints.

Chosen path (minimal number of law adoptions):
 1. stabilize atoms-stable         → enables: —
 2. stabilize chemistry-stable     → enables: carbon-chemistry
 3. stabilize communication-stable → enables: —
 4. stabilize gravity-stable       → enables: galaxies, language, life, mind, observers, stars
 5. stabilize population-dynamics  → enables: culture, many-minds

Final laws:     atoms-stable, chemistry-stable, communication-stable, gravity-stable, population-dynamics.
Final features: carbon-chemistry, culture, galaxies, language, life, many-minds, mind, observers, stars.

Final world id (law-mask) = 199
Via Holds₁ we have:
  Holds1(feat:carbon-chemistry, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:culture, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:galaxies, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:language, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:life, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:many-minds, 199) = True
  Holds1(feat:mind, 199) = True

Reason why
----------
We imagine a tiny 'library' of candidate laws and a space of worlds:
  • Worlds are subsets of CANDIDATE_LAWS, encoded as integers 0..2^N−1.
  • Each law ℓ gives a unary predicate-name law:ℓ.
  • Each emergent feature f gives a unary predicate-name feat:f.

The higher-order-looking predicates are interpreted by a fixed FO core:
  • Holds₁(P, w)  — the unary predicate named by P holds in world w.
      - if P = law:ℓ, this means 'ℓ is among the laws of w';
      - if P = feat:f, this means 'f is supported by all its prerequisites in w'.
  • Holds₂(rel:requires, feat:f, Q)  — the intension Q is a direct prerequisite of f.

Implementation-wise, the FO core is a closure operator on features:
  starting from a law-mask, we repeatedly add any feature whose law
  and feature prerequisites are already satisfied, until a fixed point.

The search then explores law-adoption paths breadth-first from the empty world.
Whenever a world w satisfies all observation features O (i.e.
  for every o in O: Holds1(feat:o, w) is true), it is a candidate endpoint.
Among all such endpoints we keep one with:
  • minimal path length (fewest adoptions), and
  • if there are ties, lexicographically smallest action sequence.

The printed plan is therefore a shortest explanation, in terms of
law adoptions, of how our observation-set can obtain given this library.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: 'requires' relation encodes basic feature prerequisites.
PASS 2: Holds1 behaves correctly for laws/features in tiny worlds.
PASS 3: Final world satisfies all observation features via Holds1.
PASS 4: Each adopted law is individually necessary for the observations.
PASS 5: Features grow monotonically and enabled-features are consistent.
PASS 6: infer_features and Holds1 agree on the final feature set.
All checks passed.
