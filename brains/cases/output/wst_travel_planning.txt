Model
=====
States (time steps) = ['S0', 'S1', 'S2', 'S3']
Locations as classes: At_Brussels, At_Paris, At_London, At_Berlin

Fixed predicates (informal)
----------------------------
• holds1(C,S)  — class-name C holds in state S (implemented as a map state→classes)
• holds2(A,S,S1) — do action-name A from S to S1 (implemented as a set of triples)
• Pre/Add/Cost/Time are compiled into a small Action schema (no runtime rules).

Initial & step graph
--------------------
Initial: At_Brussels holds in S0; step chain S0→S1→S2→S3.

Actions (cost, time)
--------------------
• Fly Brussels→Paris (cost 1, time 1) | Train Brussels→Paris (2, 2)
• Fly Paris→London (1, 2) [Forbidden for planning] | Fly Paris→Berlin (2, 2)
• Train London→Berlin (2, 3)

Planning policy
----------------
• Forbidden actions (here: Fly_Paris_London) are still present as transitions,
  but they are NOT used when computing PathCost/PathTime/BestCost/BestTime.

Question
========
Q1) Enumerate all plan edges holds2(A,S,S1).
Q2) Minimal COST to reach any state where At_Berlin holds.
Q3) Minimal TIME to reach any state where At_Berlin holds.
Q4) Example (COST, TIME) value sets to S2.
Q5) Policy: does a transition using Fly_Paris_London appear (Forbidden)?

Answer
======
Q1) Fly_Brussels_Paris:S0->S1, Fly_Paris_Berlin:S1->S2, Fly_Paris_London:S1->S2, Train_Brussels_Paris:S0->S1, Train_London_Berlin:S2->S3
Q2) minimal costs to Berlin states: S2@cost=3, S3@cost=5
Q3) minimal times to Berlin states: S2@time=3, S3@time=6
Q4) for S2: PathCost in ['3', '4'], PathTime in ['3', '4']
Q5) Forbidden action Fly_Paris_London among transitions: Yes

Reason why
==========
• We keep names as intensions (URIs) and use holds₁/holds₂-style relations, but
  all reasoning is implemented with small, explicit Python closures.
• Enabling is handled by checking preconditions (At_city) in the FROM state and
  following the small Next-chain S0→S1→S2→S3.
• Cost and time are tiny naturals (0..9) with a saturating addition sat_add.
• PathCost/PathTime accumulate measures from S0 to each state using only actions
  that are NOT Forbidden, modeling a simple policy-aware planner.
• BestCost/BestTime are true minima per state, computed directly from the sets.
• Forbidden actions remain visible in holds2, so policies can be inspected in
  queries while still being excluded from preferred plans.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: Core transitions generated (S0→S1 via Fly_BP; S1→S2 via Fly_PB).
PASS 2: Berlin reachable at S2.
PASS 3: PathCost to S2 exists.
PASS 4: A cost 3 plan to S2 exists.
PASS 5: BestCost(S2)=3 under policy-aware planning.
PASS 6: PathTime to S2 includes 3.
PASS 7: BestTime(S2)=3 under policy-aware planning.
PASS 8: Forbidden action detectable among transitions.
PASS 9: No transitions from S3.
PASS 10: London reachable at S2 despite policy (world semantics).
PASS 11: Model rebuilding is stable (same holds1, holds2, paths, minima).
PASS 12: Policy respected in PathCost/BestCost (no cost-2 plan to S2).
