Model
=====
Individuals D = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave', 'Erin', 'Frank']

Fixed predicates (informal)
----------------------------
• holds2(R,x,y)  — application (⟨x,y⟩ ∈ ext(R))
• SubRelOf(P,Q)  — inclusion over relation names (P ⊆ Q)
• Union(P,Q,R)   — R = P ∪ Q
• Comp(P,Q,R)    — R = P ∘ Q
• Star(P,R)      — R = P⁺ (non-reflexive transitive closure)
• leq_strict / leq — ⊆* with/without reflex on names

Named relations (with base facts)
---------------------------------
Follows     = {⟨Alice,Bob⟩, ⟨Bob,Carol⟩, ⟨Bob,Dave⟩, ⟨Carol,Dave⟩, ⟨Erin,Frank⟩}
Mentors     = {⟨Alice,Carol⟩, ⟨Dave,Erin⟩}
Collaborates= {⟨Bob,Frank⟩, ⟨Carol,Erin⟩}
Knows       = derived; intended Follows ∪ Mentors ∪ Collaborates
TwoHop      = derived; intended Knows ∘ Knows
ReachK      = derived; intended Knows⁺ (length ≥ 1)

Inclusions over names:
  Follows ⊆ Knows, Mentors ⊆ Knows, Collaborates ⊆ Knows
Constructors over names:
  Union(Follows,Mentors,Knows), Union(Knows,Collaborates,Knows),
  Comp(Knows,Knows,TwoHop), Star(Knows,ReachK)

Question
========
Q1) List all (X,Y) with holds2(TwoHop,X,Y).
Q2) ∃R: Comp(Knows,Knows,R) ∧ holds2(R,Alice,Dave) ? (witness relation-names).
Q3) ∀R,y: (leq(R,Knows) ∧ holds2(R,Alice,y)) → holds2(ReachK,Alice,y) ?

Answer
======
Q1) TwoHop = {⟨Alice,Carol⟩, ⟨Alice,Dave⟩, ⟨Alice,Erin⟩, ⟨Alice,Frank⟩, ⟨Bob,Dave⟩, ⟨Bob,Erin⟩, ⟨Carol,Erin⟩, ⟨Carol,Frank⟩, ⟨Dave,Frank⟩}
Q2) Witness relation-names R = {TwoHop}
Q3) Universal statement holds: Yes

Reason why
==========
• Knows is both the union of base links and a superrelation via SubRelOf;
  we materialize it by applying Union over relation extensions.
• TwoHop = Knows ∘ Knows is computed via relational composition.
• ReachK = Knows⁺ is computed as the transitive closure (length ≥ 1) of Knows.
• leq_strict and leq are closures over SubRelOf, entirely at the NAME level.
• Q2 quantifies over relation names to find R with Comp(Knows,Knows,R).
• Q3 states that any R below Knows cannot add new Alice-targets beyond ReachK.

Check (harness)
===============
PASS 1: Knows = Follows ∪ Mentors ∪ Collaborates.
PASS 2: TwoHop = Knows ∘ Knows is correct.
PASS 3: Witness set for Alice→Dave under Comp(Knows,Knows,R) is {TwoHop}.
PASS 4: Universal property (R ≤ Knows ⇒ ReachK covers Alice-targets) holds.
PASS 5: TwoHop is non-reflexive here.
PASS 6: ReachK is non-reflexive here.
PASS 7: leq reflexivity holds for all relation names.
PASS 8: leq_strict inclusions Follows/Mentors/Collaborates ⊆ Knows hold.
PASS 9: TwoHop contains Alice→Dave as a 2-hop path.
PASS 10: ReachK = Knows⁺ matches reference transitive closure.
PASS 11: Model rebuilding is stable (same holds2 and leq).
PASS 12: Pretty printing is deterministic.
