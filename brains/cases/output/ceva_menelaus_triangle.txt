Ceva and Menelaus (field-plane versions):
  • Ceva: For a triangle ABC with points D∈BC, E∈CA, F∈AB, the cevians
      AD, BE, CF are concurrent ⇔ (BD/DC)·(CE/EA)·(AF/FB) = 1.
  • Menelaus: For a triangle ABC with D∈BC, E∈CA, F∈AB, the points
      D, E, F are collinear ⇔ (BD/DC)·(CE/EA)·(AF/FB) = -1.
Over a field, these are purely algebraic statements about ratios, and
hold in finite projective planes PG(2, p) over GF(p).

Empirical checks in PG(2, p):

p  | Ceva (ok/total) | Menelaus (ok/total)
------------------------------------------
5  | 120/120            | 120/120
7  | 120/120            | 120/120
11 | 120/120            | 120/120

Note: In field planes PG(2, p), the algebraic forms of Ceva and Menelaus hold exactly, so the stats should show 100% success for nondegenerate samples.

Holds₁ view on theorem-names:
  p=5: Holds1(thm:Ceva, 5)=True, Holds1(thm:Menelaus, 5)=True
  p=7: Holds1(thm:Ceva, 7)=True, Holds1(thm:Menelaus, 7)=True
  p=11: Holds1(thm:Ceva, 11)=True, Holds1(thm:Menelaus, 11)=True

Reason why
----------
We model PG(2, p) with homogeneous coordinates over GF(p):
  • Points and lines are 3-component vectors modulo p, up to scalar.
  • Incidence is dot product; joins/meets are cross products.
  • Triangles, cevians, and intersections are all first-order data.

On each side of a triangle, we introduce a 1D coordinate s with the
endpoints mapped to 0 and 1. Any interior or exterior point P has a
coordinate s(P) in GF(p), and the signed segment ratio is then

      (UP / PV) = s(P) / (1 - s(P)).

The Ceva and Menelaus products are just products of these ratios. For
each sampled configuration in PG(2, p), we compute:
  • concurrency or collinearity (via incidence), and
  • the corresponding product in GF(p).

The first-order core is the exact projective and algebraic computation.
From it we extract a higher-order-looking model:
  • worlds w are primes p,
  • theorem names P∈{thm:Ceva, thm:Menelaus},
  • Holds₁(P, w) is true iff every sampled config in PG(2, w) satisfies
    the equivalence for P,
  • Holds₂(rel:dual, thm:Ceva, thm:Menelaus) and its converse record
    that we are treating them as dual theorems at the intensional level.

Thus the whole story fits the 'higher-order look, first-order core'
paradigm: theorem-names and their duality relation live in an intensional
layer, while all semantic content is computed by a single first-order
engine over GF(p)-geometry.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: Basic projective primitives (line_through/dot) behave as expected.
PASS 2: Ceva equivalence holds in sampled configurations in PG(2, 5).
PASS 3: Menelaus equivalence holds in sampled configurations in PG(2, 5).
PASS 4: All sampled configurations satisfy Ceva and Menelaus for each tested p.
PASS 5: Holds₁/EXT1 match the empirical theorem statistics per world.
PASS 6: Holds₂-level duality between Ceva and Menelaus is present and symmetric.
All checks passed.
