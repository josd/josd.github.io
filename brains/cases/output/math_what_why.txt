Target observation concepts:
  arithmetic, calculus, category-theory, explanatory-power, geometry, invariants, topology, transfer-principle.

Search explored 109601 distinct axiom-sets (nodes).
Found 40320 consistent endpoints.

Chosen plan (minimal number of axiom adoptions):
 1. adopt algebra-operations       → enables: —
 2. adopt classical-logic          → enables: proofs
 3. adopt function-formation       → enables: —
 4. adopt natural-induction        → enables: —
 5. adopt order-completeness       → enables: —
 6. adopt set-existence            → enables: analysis, arithmetic, calculus, category-theory, fields, functions, naturals, reals, rings, sets, transfer-principle
 7. adopt symmetry-axioms          → enables: geometry, groups
 8. adopt topology-axioms          → enables: explanatory-power, invariants, topology

Final axioms:   algebra-operations, classical-logic, function-formation, natural-induction, order-completeness, set-existence, symmetry-axioms, topology-axioms.
Final concepts: analysis, arithmetic, calculus, category-theory, explanatory-power, fields, functions, geometry, groups, invariants, naturals, proofs, reals, rings, sets, topology, transfer-principle.

Final world id (axiom-mask) = 255
Sample Holds₁ judgements for the final world:
  Holds1(cx:arithmetic, 255) = True
  Holds1(cx:calculus, 255) = True
  Holds1(cx:category-theory, 255) = True
  Holds1(cx:explanatory-power, 255) = True

Reason why
----------
We model mathematics at two levels:
  • A *world* is a set of adopted axioms, encoded as an integer 0..2^N−1.
  • Each axiom a has a unary predicate-name ax:a, each concept c has cx:c.
    The fixed predicate Holds₁(ax:a, w) says “a is adopted in world w”.
    The fixed predicate Holds₁(cx:c, w) says “c is available in world w”.

Direct dependencies between intensions are recorded by Holds₂:
  Holds₂(rel:requires, cx:c, Q) means that Q (an ax:… or cx:…) is a
  direct prerequisite of concept c. We compile these from PREREQUISITES.

The real semantic work is done by a first-order closure operator:
  infer_concepts(ax_mask) repeatedly adds any concept whose axiom
  and concept prerequisites are already satisfied, until a fixed point.
This operator induces EXT1 and therefore all Holds₁ facts.

The search then explores axiom-adoption paths breadth-first, starting
from the empty world (no axioms). Whenever a world w satisfies all
observation concepts, it is a candidate endpoint. Among these:
  • we keep a world with the smallest number of adopted axioms, and
  • if there are ties, the lexicographically smallest action sequence.

The printed plan is therefore a shortest explanation, in terms of
axiom adoptions, of how our chosen WHAT/WHY concepts can obtain.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: Holds₂(rel:requires, …) encodes key dependencies.
PASS 2: Holds₁ behaves correctly in small toy worlds.
PASS 3: Final world satisfies all observation concepts via Holds₁.
PASS 4: infer_concepts and Holds₁ agree on the final concept set.
PASS 5: Concepts grow monotonically and enabled-concepts are consistent.
PASS 6: Each adopted axiom is individually necessary for the observations.
PASS 7: Chosen plan is shortest with respect to this search space.
PASS 8: Concept dependency graph is acyclic (no circular definitions).
PASS 9: Permutation robustness trivially holds (no trials requested).
All checks passed.
