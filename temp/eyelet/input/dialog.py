"""
Socratic Dialogue Emulator (deterministic)
========================================
This script *simulates* a Socratic conversation between a teacher and a student
**without** any external LLM.  All variability now comes from Python’s `random`
module, but we expose a `--seed` flag (default **42**) so that every run with
the same arguments produces identical output.

Usage
-----
```bash
python socratic.py --topic "Pythagorean theorem" --steps 6 --seed 42
```
Change the seed (or omit the flag) if you ever *do* want different dialogue.
Only the Python standard library is required.
