We consider 2×2 real matrices with four different products:
  world 0: A ⊗₀ B = A·B (standard matrix product),
  world 1: A ⊗₁ B = A∘B (Hadamard / entrywise product),
  world 2: A ⊗₂ B = A·B + B·A (symmetric, Jordan-like product),
  world 3: A ⊗₃ B = A·B + A (deliberately broken).
and a shared addition A⊕B given by entrywise sum.
We treat two properties as theorems:
  AssocMult:   (A⊗B)⊗C = A⊗(B⊗C),
  DistLeft:    A⊗(B⊕C) = (A⊗B) ⊕ (A⊗C).

Empirical results (random tests over small integer matrices):

world | product description        | Assoc (ok/total) | DistLeft (ok/total)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
0    | standard product A·B       | 200/200              | 200/200
1    | Hadamard product A∘B       | 200/200              | 200/200
2    | symmetric AB+BA            | 5/201              | 200/200
3    | broken AB+A                | 1/201              | 0/201

Heuristically, we expect: worlds 0 and 1 (standard and Hadamard) to satisfy both associativity and left-distributivity; world 2 to be non-associative but still left-distributive (bilinear AB+BA); and world 3 to fail both properties.

Holds₁ view on theorem-names:
  world 0: Holds1(thm:AssocMult, 0)=True, Holds1(thm:DistLeft, 0)=True
  world 1: Holds1(thm:AssocMult, 1)=True, Holds1(thm:DistLeft, 1)=True
  world 2: Holds1(thm:AssocMult, 2)=False, Holds1(thm:DistLeft, 2)=True
  world 3: Holds1(thm:AssocMult, 3)=False, Holds1(thm:DistLeft, 3)=False

Reason why
----------
The first-order core of this script is plain 2×2 matrix arithmetic:
  • matrices are tuples of floats,
  • addition is entrywise, shared by all worlds,
  • products differ by world (standard, Hadamard, AB+BA, AB+A).

For each world we sample many random triples A,B,C with small integer
entries and test the equations for AssocMult and DistLeft. From these
tests we decide whether a world "empirically" satisfies each theorem,
and we build an extensional model:
  • worlds: w ∈ {0,1,2,3},
  • theorem-names: thm:AssocMult, thm:DistLeft,
  • EXT1[thm:AssocMult] = { w | all sampled triples satisfy associativity },
  • EXT1[thm:DistLeft]  = { w | all sampled triples satisfy left-distributivity }.

We then define a unary predicate Holds₁ by
  Holds1(P, w)  ⇔  w ∈ EXT1[P],
and a binary predicate Holds₂ using
  EXT2[rel:stronger] = { (thm:AssocMult, thm:DistLeft) },
so that
  Holds2(rel:stronger, X, Y)  ⇔  (X, Y) ∈ EXT2[rel:stronger].

Thus the seemingly higher-order claims
  "world 2 is non-associative but left-distributive"
or
  "AssocMult is stronger than DistLeft in this toy universe"
are represented via Holds₁/Holds₂ over a finite set of intensions, while
all mathematical content lives in a simple, first-order-style matrix engine.

Check (harness)
---------------
PASS 1: Basic matrix arithmetic (standard, Hadamard) behaves as expected.
PASS 2: Associativity holds in worlds 0–1 and fails for a concrete triple in world 2.
PASS 3: Left-distributivity holds concretely in worlds 0–2 and fails in world 3.
PASS 4: Statistics match the expected pattern for all four worlds.
PASS 5: Holds₁/EXT1 match the empirical statistics for all worlds and theorems.
PASS 6: 'AssocMult' is stronger than 'DistLeft' in all worlds where it holds.
All checks passed.
