P3 — Prompt → Program → Proof  (Deterministic, P3 style, audience-friendly)

TOPIC (in plain language)
-------------------------
Your immune system improves antibodies inside small "training camps" called
germinal centers. Two ideas run at the same time:

• Exploit: push forward the antibodies that currently bind best.
• Explore: keep some diverse alternatives in case there’s a better solution
  elsewhere — or the target (virus) changes.

We compare two learning strategies on a toy “binding score map”:
  A) Greedy hill-climb — follows one path and always picks the best small step.
  B) Germinal-center style — many paths in parallel with soft (graded) selection
     and a small recycled, diverse tail.

WHAT WE REPORT AS PROOF
-----------------------
After a fixed number of rounds, we print three metrics:
  1) Best single-clone affinity      (did anyone become excellent?)
  2) Mean population affinity        (did the whole team improve?)
  3) Robustness to antigen “drift”   (if the target shifts a bit, who stays good?)

We then run a small **harness** that varies the number of rounds, the drift
amount, and how sharp the selection is — to show the result isn’t a fluke.

DETERMINISM
-----------
No randomness is used. A tiny sine-hash produces pseudo-random-looking but
fully reproducible offsets. Every run prints the same numbers.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
If the germinal-center (GC) strategy wins a metric, that’s evidence of a
natural “math-like” optimization: many candidates scored in parallel with
graded rewards and a protected diversity tail — balancing exploration and
exploitation without anyone “doing equations.”
