P3 — Prompt → Program → Proof  (Deterministic, audience-friendly)

TOPIC (plain language)
----------------------
Ants lay pheromones on the ground. When several routes compete between the nest
and food, shorter routes accumulate pheromone faster (they can be completed more
often per unit time), so more ants choose them, which adds even more pheromone.
That positive feedback makes the colony behave like it’s **solving a shortest-path
problem** — “math without math class.”

WHAT WE DO
----------
We build a tiny map with multiple routes from a **Nest (A)** to **Food (E)**.
We compare three policies:

1) **Dijkstra (ground truth)** – exact shortest path length (what an oracle would pick).
2) **Greedy-nearest** – at each junction, pick the locally shortest edge (myopic).
3) **Ant pheromone rule (deterministic ACO)** – repeated traversals with:
   score(edge) = (pheromone^α) * (1/length^β); pheromone evaporates (ρ) and
   deposits are proportional to 1 / path_length. No randomness; ties break by name.

We show the ant rule converges to the Dijkstra shortest path and beats the naive
greedy strategy on total distance.

DETERMINISM
-----------
No RNG at all. Initial pheromones are equal; tie-breaking is lexical/topological.
Every run prints the same numbers.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
The colony-level behavior implements a feedback algorithm that **optimizes** a
global quantity (distance) using only local rules — a clear example of natural
computation by non-humans.
