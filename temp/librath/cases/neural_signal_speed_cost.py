TOPIC (plain language)
----------------------
Nerve signals travel along axons. Big, fat, heavily myelinated axons send impulses fast,
but they take up more space and burn more energy. Thin axons save energy and room,
but conduct slowly. The body needs a balance between **speed** and **cost**.

This is a physical optimization problem the nervous system seems to solve everywhere.

Simple physics/biology relationships
------------------------------------
• Conduction velocity:       v ∝ r^0.5    (bigger axon, faster signal)
• Metabolic & volume cost:   C ∝ r^2      (bigger axon, higher cost)
• Delay per signal:          T ∝ 1/v ∝ r^-0.5

We want to minimize a combined "neural cost"
    J(r) = α*T + β*C  = α/r^0.5 + β*r^2
where α weights how much delay matters and β weights how costly big axons are.

WHAT WE DO (the P3 structure)
-----------------------------
• Prompt → model this cost mathematically.
• Program → compute J(r) and its optimum for various α/β ratios.
• Proof → show that the optimum satisfies r^(5/2) ∝ α/β and that this predicts
  the observed range of axon sizes across species.

We then check robustness (vary α, β) and verify the "cube-law-like" relationship holds.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Each axon behaves like it's solving a tiny optimization problem: "How big should I be to
balance speed vs. energy?"  There’s no conscious math — evolution and biophysics *are*
the math.
