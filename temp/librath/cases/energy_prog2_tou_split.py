P3 — Program 2: Time-of-Use Split (Peak vs Off-peak)

Short story:
  With a daily baseline, split usage into peak and off-peak portions using a
  simple hour model (typical_hour and shiftability).

Overview:
  - Reads './cases/bus/energy/baseline_daily.json'.
  - Splits kWh/day into peak vs off-peak by each appliance.
  - Prints Answer/Reasons/Check; writes './cases/bus/energy/tou_split.json' for Program 3.
