Reason Why
----------
- Delfour ↔ Community Pharmacy (insight request):
  Avg 78% with 5/5 elements ≥60%. Classification: INFINITE-MINDED. Derivation: Derives insights near data (zero-copy/federated). Minimization: Minimizes data with purpose limits & safeguards. Activation: Value via insight contracts / pay-per-insight / mutual gain. Equilibrium: Balanced Trinity across tech/legal/business. Copy-Resistance: Copy-resistant via contract/expiry/rate limits.
- Mobility Pass ↔ City Parking (dynamic pricing via insights):
  Avg 74% with 5/5 elements ≥60%. Classification: INFINITE-MINDED. Derivation: Derives insights near data (zero-copy/federated). Minimization: Minimizes data with purpose limits & safeguards. Activation: Value via insight contracts / pay-per-insight / mutual gain. Equilibrium: Balanced Trinity across tech/legal/business. Copy-Resistance: Copy-resistant via contract/expiry/rate limits.
- Clinical Research Board ↔ EHR Network (trial feasibility):
  Avg 70% with 3/5 elements ≥60%. Classification: INFINITE-MINDED. Derivation: Derives insights near data (zero-copy/federated). Minimization: Minimizes data with purpose limits & safeguards. Activation: Value via insight contracts / pay-per-insight / mutual gain. Equilibrium: Balanced Trinity across tech/legal/business.
- AdTech Broker (warehouse the web):
  Avg 28% with 1/5 elements ≥60%. Classification: FINITE-MINDED. Equilibrium: Balanced Trinity across tech/legal/business. Red flags: Broad/profiling without minimization.; Data-hoarding business model.; Raw data exports undermine copy-resistance.
- Insurer Bulk EHR Import (risk scoring):
  Avg 31% with 1/5 elements ≥60%. Classification: FINITE-MINDED. Equilibrium: Balanced Trinity across tech/legal/business. Red flags: Broad/profiling without minimization.; Data-hoarding business model.; Raw data exports undermine copy-resistance.

Check
-----
Checks run: 16 invariants + 10 unit tests = 26 total

Invariants
----------
[PASS] I1 — average equals mean of pillars
[PASS] I2 — each pillar within [0,1]
[PASS] I3 — strong_count matches pillars ≥ 0.60
[PASS] I4 — if infinite-minded then (avg/strong/penalty) preconditions hold
[PASS] I5 — if penalty ≥ 0.25 then must be finite-minded
[PASS] I6 — narrative includes canonical label
[PASS] I7 — reasons_map keys match pillar keys
[PASS] I8 — average between min and max pillar values
[PASS] I9 — deterministic: re-evaluation matches
[PASS] I10 — zero flags + thresholds ⇒ infinite-minded
[PASS] I11 — all pillars ≥ 0.70 ⇒ infinite-minded
[PASS] I12 — raw_export present ⇒ narrative includes raw-export flag
[PASS] I13 — thresholds met & penalty < 0.25 ⇒ infinite-minded (contrapositive)
[PASS] I14 — penalty equals 0.15 × distinct flag buckets
[PASS] I15 — very imbalanced Trinity ⇒ low Equilibrium
[PASS] I16 — near-equal Trinity ⇒ high Equilibrium

Unit Tests
----------
[PASS] U1 — All-High-Insight ⇒ infinite-minded
[PASS] U2 — All-Low-DataLake ⇒ finite-minded
[PASS] U3 — Near-But-Avg-Below (avg below) ⇒ finite-minded
[PASS] U4 — Avg-High-But-Flagged (penalty ≥0.25) ⇒ finite-minded
[PASS] U5 — Imbalanced-Trinity doesn’t sneak through on average alone
[PASS] U6 — Finite wording alone doesn’t block if Trinity holds
[PASS] U7 — Monotonicity: adding supportive tag doesn’t reduce Derivation
[PASS] U8 — One flag (0.15) with high pillars can still be infinite-minded
[PASS] U9 — Two flags (0.30) force finite-minded
[PASS] U10 — Removing raw_export raises Copy-Resistance

Summary
-------
Invariants: 16/16 PASS
Unit tests: 10/10 PASS
OVERALL: PASS
