Answer
------
For any right triangle with legs a, b and hypotenuse c,
the Pythagorean Theorem holds:  a² + b² = c².

Reason why
----------
Drop the altitude from the right angle to the hypotenuse, splitting it into
segments of lengths p and q. By AA similarity:
  p/b = b/c  ⇒  p = b²/c,      q/a = a/c  ⇒  q = a²/c,      and  p + q = c.
Adding c·p and c·q gives  b² + a² = c(p+q) = c².
The altitude satisfies  h = (ab)/c  and  h² = pq, consistent with the similarity.
