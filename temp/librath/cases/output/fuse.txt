Answer
------
Goal: false
Result: ✔ PROVED

Proof trace:
Step 01: prove ('false',)
  → via R-fuse
  Step 02: prove ('?X', ':color', ':black')
    ✓ fact (':stone', ':color', ':black')
  Step 03: prove (':stone', ':color', ':white')
    ✓ fact (':stone', ':color', ':white')

Reason why
----------
The rule encodes a *fuse* (inconsistency detector):
  if some ?X has color :black AND color :white, then derive `false`.
In the data, :stone has both :black and :white, so the body succeeds
with ?X←:stone and the head `false` is concluded. The backward prover
starts from the goal `false`, unifies it with the rule head, then
proves each body atom from the facts.

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: both-colors entity exists; rule fires; proof disappears if any color is removed.
