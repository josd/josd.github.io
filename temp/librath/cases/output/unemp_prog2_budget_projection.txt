# ANSWER
{
  "weekly_outlay_eur": 410.0,
  "projected_total_outlay_eur": 10660.0,
  "annual_contributions_eur": 2800.0,
  "population_count": 7
}

# REASONS
- Weekly outlay = sum(WBA of eligible) = €410.0.
- Total outlay = average duration × weekly outlay; assumes all weeks claimed.
- Contributions = population × covered_wage_base × employer_rate = 7 × €20000 × 2.00%.
