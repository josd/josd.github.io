============================================================
The Barber Paradox — outer limits of reason (classical logic)
============================================================

Setup:
  Predicate S(x,y): 'x shaves y'.  Constant b: 'the barber'.
  Barber condition (axiom):  ∀y [ S(b,y) ↔ ¬S(y,y) ]
  Abbreviation: p := S(b,b)

Key instance (y := b):
  S(b,b) ↔ ¬S(b,b)   i.e.,   p ↔ ¬p

Answer:
  No classical truth-value assignment satisfies p ↔ ¬p.
  Under the barber axiom with two-valued classical logic, p has no consistent value.

Reason why:
  • Assume p is True (S(b,b)).
  • From ∀y [S(b,y) ↔ ¬S(y,y)], instantiating y := b gives S(b,b) ↔ ¬S(b,b).
  • Thus from p we infer ¬p. Contradiction (p ∧ ¬p).
  • Hence no classical truth value makes p ↔ ¬p true.

  • Assume p is False (¬S(b,b)).
  • From S(b,b) ↔ ¬S(b,b), the right-hand side says ¬p, which matches the left.
  • But then the biconditional forces p. Contradiction (p ∧ ¬p).
  • Hence no classical truth value makes p ↔ ¬p true.

  Takeaway:
  Taken at face value, the barber condition self-destructs in classical logic.
  Consistent formalisms avoid it by blocking self-application (typing, domain tweaks,
  or curbing 'all-and-only' definitions).

Check (harness):
  Trying p ∈ {False, True} against the constraint (p == (not p))...
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no assignment makes p ↔ ¬p true.

  Truth table for p and (p == (not p)):
    p      not p    (p == not p)
    False  True    False
    True   False   False

Conclusion:
  The barber axiom forces p ↔ ¬p at p = S(b,b), so there is no classical model —
  a precise 'outer limit of reason' for this setup. □
