Answer
------
For every n ≥ 1, the sum of the first n odd numbers equals n²:
  1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n−1) = n²

Reason why
----------
Proof by induction on n:
• Base (n=1):  1 = 1².  True.
• Step: assume 1+3+…+(2n−1) = n². Then
    1+3+…+(2n−1)+(2(n+1)−1) = n² + (2n+1) = (n+1)².
  Hence the statement holds for n+1. By induction, it holds for all n ≥ 1. □

Geometric intuition:
  Build an n×n square of dots (n²). To get (n+1)², add an L-shaped border
  of exactly 2n+1 dots — the next odd number. Repeating produces all squares.
