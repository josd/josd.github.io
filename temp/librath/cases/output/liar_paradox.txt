The Liar — outer limits of reason (classical logic)
============================================================

Sentence:
  L := "This sentence is false."

Naïve classical schema:
  True(L) ≡ L  ⇒  L ≡ ¬L

Answer:
  No classical truth-value assignment satisfies L ≡ ¬L.
  Under the stated assumptions, the liar sentence has no consistent classical truth value.

Reason why:
  • Assume L is True.
  • Given the schema L ≡ ¬L, the right-hand side must match the left-hand side.
  • So ¬L must be True. But by classical negation, ¬L is False.
  • Contradiction: ¬L cannot be both True and False.
  • Equivalently: from L and (L ≡ ¬L) we infer ¬L; hence L ∧ ¬L.

  • Assume L is False.
  • Given the schema L ≡ ¬L, the right-hand side must match the left-hand side.
  • So ¬L must be False. But by classical negation, ¬L is True.
  • Contradiction: ¬L cannot be both False and True.
  • Equivalently: from ¬L and (L ≡ ¬L) we infer L; hence L ∧ ¬L.

  Takeaway:
  Without changing the rules (e.g., restricting self-reference, stratifying truth,
  or altering the logic), the liar sits at an 'outer limit of reason' for this system.

Check (harness):
  Trying L ∈ {False, True} against the constraint (L == (not L))...
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no assignment makes L ≡ ¬L true.

  Truth table for L and (L == (not L)):
    L      not L    (L == not L)
    False  True    False
    True   False   False

Conclusion:
  In plain classical logic, assuming L ≡ ¬L forces contradiction either way—
  a precise, technical sense in which the liar marks an 'outer limit of reason.' □
