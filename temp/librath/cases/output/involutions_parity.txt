ANSWER
========================================================================
In any finite group G, the number of solutions to x^2 = e has the same
parity as |G|. In particular, |G| is odd  ⇔  the only solution is x = e.
========================================================================
REASON WHY
========================================================================
Pairing-by-inverse argument.
For any finite group G, partition G into {x, x^{-1}} pairs.
• If x ≠ x^{-1}, then {x, x^{-1}} contributes 2 elements — an even number.
• The only unpaired elements are those with x = x^{-1}, i.e., x^2 = e.
Therefore the parity of |G| equals the parity of the number of solutions
to x^2 = e. In symbols,  # {x : x^2=e} ≡ |G| (mod 2).

Corollary (odd order).
If |G| is odd, the congruence forces exactly one solution, namely x=e.
Conversely, if x=e is the unique solution, then the number of solutions
is 1, which is odd, hence |G| is odd.
