Answer

Conclusion: not flies(Tweety)

Reason why
----------
Facts & strict derivations:
  • bird(Tweety)  — From R1 using [penguin(Tweety)].
  • penguin(Tweety)  — Given as a fact.

Competing defeasible arguments:
  • flies(Tweety): R2 (priority 1) from [bird(Tweety)]
  • flies(Tweety): R2 (priority 1) from [bird(Tweety)]
  • not flies(Tweety): R3 (priority 2) from [penguin(Tweety)]
  • not flies(Tweety): R3 (priority 2) from [penguin(Tweety)]

Resolution: REJECT flies(Tweety) — not flies(Tweety) is supported by a stronger, more specific rule.

Check (harness)
----------------
[PASS] not flies(Tweety)    expected=True got=True — Specific penguin rule defeats general bird rule
[PASS] flies(Robin)         expected=True got=True — Ordinary bird should fly
[PASS] lays_eggs(Tweety)    expected=True got=True — Birds typically lay eggs; Tweety is (strictly) a bird
[PASS] flies(Tweety)        expected=False got=False — Tweety should not fly due to stronger contrary rule

4/4 tests passed.
