Answer

Solutions that satisfy the query (?X eats ?Y and ?Y eats :grain):

# | X (Animal) | Y (Animal)   | Y eats :grain | Choices
--+------------+--------------+---------------+--------
1 | :bird      | :caterpillar | Yes           | 1      
2 | :fox       | :bird        | Yes           | 3      

How each solution is derived (minimal choices):
1. X=:bird, Y=:caterpillar
    - :caterpillar eats :grain
2. X=:fox, Y=:bird
    - :snail eats :grain
    - :bird eats :grain
    - :fox eats :bird

Reason
------
• Typing rules make each creature an :Animal and :grain a :Plant; size facts give:
  :caterpillar < :bird < :fox < :wolf, and :snail < :bird.
• Deterministic diet: every :Bird eats any :Caterpillar, so :bird eats :caterpillar.
• Existential diet: :Snail and :Caterpillar each eat *some* :Plant; we can instantiate
  that as :grain (or :somePlant).
• Big disjunctive rule: if a smaller animal Y eats a plant, a larger X either eats a plant
  or eats Y. Constraints forbid (:Wolf eats :Fox), (:Wolf eats :Grain), and (:Bird eats :Snail).
• This yields two canonical goal patterns:
  – Bird→Caterpillar→Grain: choose that the caterpillar eats :grain; then the bird (deterministic)
    eats the caterpillar. (X=:bird, Y=:caterpillar)
  – Fox→Bird→Grain: make a bird herbivorous via a smaller snail/caterpillar and the big rule
    (choose :grain), then the fox (larger) eats the bird. (X=:fox, Y=:bird)

Check (harness)
----------------
• BFS nodes (minimal models): explored up to a safe cap.
• Enumeration up to depth 4: also bounded for safety.
• Validate :bird eats :caterpillar and :caterpillar eats :grain: OK
• Validate :fox eats :bird and :bird eats :grain: OK
• Constraints satisfied on a minimal world: YES
