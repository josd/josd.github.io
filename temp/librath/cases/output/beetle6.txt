Applying evidence: bad ← beautiful ; evidence(bad,false)
W1: blue    beautiful holds ⇒ bad would be true ⇒ DROP
W2: nice    beautiful false ⇒ bad false ⇒ KEEP
W3: pretty  beautiful holds ⇒ bad would be true ⇒ DROP
Surviving worlds: nice
Answer
======

--- Trace for prop(nice,beetle) ---
World 1: nice    ✓ nice
Result: VALID — true in all 1 surviving worlds.

--- Trace for prop(beautiful,beetle) ---
World 1: nice    ✗ beautiful
Result: UNSATISFIABLE — false in all 1 surviving worlds.

--- Trace for prop(blue,beetle) ---
World 1: nice    ✗ blue
Result: UNSATISFIABLE — false in all 1 surviving worlds.

Summary
-------
prop(nice,beetle): VALID
prop(beautiful,beetle): UNSATISFIABLE
prop(blue,beetle): UNSATISFIABLE

Reason why
==========
Three exclusive worlds encode uncertainty about the beetle:
  • W1 = blue
  • W2 = green ∧ nice
  • W3 = green ∧ pretty
Rules make beautiful true exactly in worlds with blue or pretty.
Since bad ← beautiful and the evidence requires bad=false, any
world with beautiful must be dropped. Only W2 (green ∧ nice) remains.
Therefore:
  • prop(nice,beetle) is VALID (true in the only surviving world).
  • prop(beautiful,beetle) is UNSATISFIABLE post-evidence.
  • prop(blue,beetle) is UNSATISFIABLE post-evidence.

Check (harness)
===============
Only W2 ('nice') survives? True
In surviving worlds: ¬beautiful ∧ ¬bad ∧ nice ? True
Classifications correct? True
Applying evidence: bad ← beautiful ; evidence(bad,false)
W1: blue    beautiful holds ⇒ bad would be true ⇒ DROP
W2: nice    beautiful false ⇒ bad false ⇒ KEEP
W3: pretty  beautiful holds ⇒ bad would be true ⇒ DROP
Surviving worlds: nice
Evidence & classify() are deterministic/idempotent? True

All checks passed? True
