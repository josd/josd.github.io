Answer:
Hessenberg’s theorem (1905): In any projective plane, if Pappus’ theorem holds for all appropriate configurations (i.e., the plane is Pappian), then Desargues’ theorem also holds for all configurations (i.e., the plane is Desarguesian).

Reason:
Modern algebraic reason (4 lines):
  (1) A projective plane with Pappus can be coordinatized by a commutative division ring (a field).
  (2) Projective planes over any division ring (commutative or not) satisfy Desargues.
  (3) Every field is a division ring.
  (4) Therefore Pappus ⇒ Desargues.

Hessenberg’s synthetic reconstruction (outline, no coordinates):
  • Setup: Work in a projective plane where Pappus holds. Study central collineations
    (elations/homologies: collineations fixing an 'axis' line pointwise and a 'center' point).
  • Translations and shears: Using Pappus, show that the composition of two elations with
    parallel axes is again an elation and that such elations commute. This yields an abelian
    'translation group' acting freely on an affine patch (remove a line at infinity).
  • Parallelogram law: The commuting translations induce a commutative, associative 'addition'
    on each affine line (constructible purely by incidence). Pappus is precisely the geometric
    statement ensuring commutativity of this addition.
  • Homotheties and products: By combining a fixed triangle and central perspectivities,
    define 'dilations'; their composition rules are controlled by Pappus-configurations.
    This gives a commutative 'scalar' multiplication compatible with the additive structure.
  • Projectivities from a point: With this structure in hand, compare any two triangles that
    are perspective from a point O. One can map one triangle to the other by a composition of
    elations/dilations whose axis is a fixed line. The fixed line becomes the 'axis of
    perspectivity', and the three intersections of corresponding sides lie on it—this is
    exactly Desargues’ theorem. Thus Desargues follows from the Pappus-driven behavior of
    central collineations, without coordinatization.
  • Moral: Pappus forces the plane’s collineation group to behave like the affine/projective
    groups over a field; Desargues is a consequent property of such geometry.

Check (harness):
p | Pappus (ok/total) | Desargues (ok/total)
--------------------------------------------
3 | 120/120           | 120/120
5 | 120/120           | 120/120
7 | 120/120           | 120/120
11 | 120/120           | 120/120

Note: Over GF(p) both theorems are true, so we expect 100% success.
