Answer
------
Example 1:
  Given: newspaper during dinner, dinner before bed
  Deduces: newspaper before bed

           newspaper    dinner       bed
newspaper      equal   during   before
   dinner   contains    equal   before
      bed      after    after    equal

Example 2:
  Given: a meets b, b meets c
  Deduces: a before c

   a b c
a  equalmeetsbefore
b  met-byequalmeets
c  aftermet-byequal

Reason why
----------
• Allen’s 13 base relations capture all qualitative orderings of two closed intervals.
• Composition R₁∘R₂ is computed by enumerating small integer intervals a,b,c and
  collecting all R such that a R b and b R₂ c imply a R c. Only relative order
  matters, so a tiny grid (0…5) suffices to witness all qualitative patterns.
• Path consistency repeatedly tightens each pair (i,j) by intersecting R[i,j]
  with the union over k of composed paths R[i,k]∘R[k,j] until a fixpoint.

Key compositions (generated on the fly):
        during ∘ before       ⇒ ['before']
         meets ∘ meets        ⇒ ['before']
        starts ∘ before       ⇒ ['before']
      overlaps ∘ meets        ⇒ ['before']

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: converses, path-consistency, expected deductions, and composition spot-checks.
