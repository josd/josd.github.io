congestion: At t=45, every minute in [36..45] had >= 3 low-speed vehicles (counts=[(36, 4), (37, 4), (38, 4), (39, 4), (40, 4), (41, 4), (42, 4), (43, 4), (44, 4), (45, 4)]); and queue>=10 exists at [(36, 12), (40, 15)].
ghost_queue: At t=57, 5 distinct vehicles braked within minutes [56..57] (events=[(56, 'v1'), (56, 'v2'), (56, 'v3'), (56, 'v4'), (56, 'v5'), (57, 'v1'), (57, 'v2'), (57, 'v3'), (57, 'v4'), (57, 'v5')]), brakes-in-both-minutes=True, and no nearby accident in last 15 minutes.
incident_congestion: At t=40, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [26..40] at times=[35].
incident_congestion: At t=41, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [27..41] at times=[35].
incident_congestion: At t=42, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [28..42] at times=[35].
incident_congestion: At t=43, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [29..43] at times=[35].
incident_congestion: At t=44, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [30..44] at times=[35].
incident_congestion: At t=45, congestion holds and there was an accident at KM=12 in the last window [31..45] at times=[35].
