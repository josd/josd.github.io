# Derived type assertions (?S a ?C)
:Ghent a :City
:Ghent a :HumanCommunity

Result: :Ghent is inferred to be a :HumanCommunity.

Reason why
==========
We use one universal rule:
  { ?x a :City } => { ?x a :HumanCommunity }
Instantiating with ?x = :Ghent and using the fact ':Ghent a :City' yields
  ':Ghent a :HumanCommunity'. The query { ?S a ?C } lists all such type facts.

Check (harness)
===============
Contains expected {:Ghent a :City, :Ghent a :HumanCommunity}? True
Closure is a fixed point? True
Rule applies to all and only City-instances? True
Query { ?S a ?C } returns exactly the type facts? True

All checks passed? True
