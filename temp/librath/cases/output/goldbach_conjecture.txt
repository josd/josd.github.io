1/ Answer
- Verified: every even n in [4, 20000] has at least one prime sum n = p + q.
- Distribution computed for evens up to 20000.
- Fewest representations observed: 4 (count=1)
- Most representations observed   : 18480 (count=571)

2/ Reason why
- Goldbach’s (strong) conjecture says every even integer > 2 is the sum of two primes.
- We do a computational check: build a prime table (sieve) and, for each even n,
  look for some p ≤ n/2 with (n − p) also prime. If found, n has a Goldbach decomposition.
- This verifies the conjecture only up to N; it is not a proof for all integers.
