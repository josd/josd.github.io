Answer
======
Minimal crossings: 7
Number of distinct optimal solutions: 2

Start: L:{M,W,G,C}  R:{}
   1. M+G L→R  | L:{W,C}  R:{M,G}
   2. M R→L    | L:{M,W,C}  R:{G}
   3. M+C L→R  | L:{W}  R:{M,G,C}
   4. M+G R→L  | L:{M,W,G}  R:{C}
   5. M+W L→R  | L:{G}  R:{M,W,C}
   6. M R→L    | L:{M,G}  R:{W,C}
   7. M+G L→R  | L:{}  R:{M,W,G,C}
Goal reached: True   | L:{}  R:{M,W,G,C}

Reason why
==========
Constraints:
  • Boat carries the man and at most one passenger each crossing.
  • On any bank without the man, the wolf cannot be with the goat,
    and the goat cannot be with the cabbage.
Method:
  • We model states as (M,W,G,C) with 0=Left, 1=Right and use BFS.
  • BFS explores legal moves level by level, so the first time we
    discover the goal we have a shortest number of crossings.
  • We also record multiple parents to enumerate ALL shortest solutions.
