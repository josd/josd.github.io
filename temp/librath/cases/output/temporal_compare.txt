=== Answer ===
{'goal': 'Is A > B?', 'A': '2025-10-07T07:00:00-12:00', 'B': '2025-10-07T07:00:00+12:00', 'result': True}

=== Reason Why ===
Normalize to UTC and compare instants:
  A local: 2025-10-07T07:00:00-12:00  (offset -12:00:00)
  B local: 2025-10-07T07:00:00+12:00  (offset +12:00:00)
  A UTC : 2025-10-07T19:00:00Z
  B UTC : 2025-10-06T19:00:00Z
  Difference: +24:00:00 ⇒ A is later than B.
Therefore, A > B is True.

=== Check ===
Overall: OK
 - [PASS] stdlib UTC == manual UTC for A and B
 - [PASS] stdlib offset == manual offset for A and B
 - [PASS] stdlib (A>B) == manual (A>B)  => True
 - [PASS] antisymmetry/trichotomy coherence (>, <, ==)
 - [PASS] delta sign matches (A>B) when claimed greater (Δ=+24:00:00)
 - [PASS] epoch seconds comparison equals datetime comparison (ea=1759863600.0, eb=1759777200.0)
 - [PASS] round-trip parse of isoformat preserves UTC
 - [PASS] identity local = UTC + offset holds for A and B
 - [PASS] invariance under equal temporal shift k
 - [PASS] 'Z' is equivalent to '+00:00' (where applicable)
