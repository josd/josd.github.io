Houses (left → right):
House   Color      Nation       Drink          Cigar           Pet     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1       yellow     Norwegian    water          Kools           fox     
2       blue       Ukrainian    tea            Chesterfields   horse   
3       red        Englishman   milk           Old Gold        snails  
4       ivory      Spaniard     orange juice   Lucky Strike    dog     
5       green      Japanese     coffee         Parliaments     zebra   

Key facts
---------
Water is drunk by the Norwegian (house 1).
The zebra is owned by the Japanese (house 5).

Reason why
==========
We model each attribute (color, nation, drink, cigar, pet) as a permutation of 5 values,
mapping to house positions 1..5. We then enforce the 14 clues:
  • direct equalities (e.g., Englishman ↔ red, coffee ↔ green, etc.),
  • position constraints (green is immediately to the right of ivory; milk is in the middle;
    Norwegian at the first house),
  • adjacency constraints (Chesterfields next to the fox; Kools next to the horse;
    Norwegian next to the blue house).
Backtracking with early pruning guarantees we explore only consistent partial assignments,
yielding the unique classic solution (water drinker and zebra owner as shown).
