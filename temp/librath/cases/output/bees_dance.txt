# Answer
The best dance resolution (quantization step) is **5°**, yielding a success rate of 100.00%.

# Reason Why (Deterministic geometric simulation)
- Resolution  5° → success rate 100.00% (with ±5° decoding noise, ±10° tolerance).
- Resolution 10° → success rate 100.00% (with ±5° decoding noise, ±10° tolerance).
- Resolution 15° → success rate 96.36% (with ±5° decoding noise, ±10° tolerance).
- Resolution 20° → success rate 88.64% (with ±5° decoding noise, ±10° tolerance).
Ranking (higher is better): 5° > 10° > 15° > 20°

# Check (Recompute deterministically for verification)
- Recheck  5° → 100.00% (stable)
- Recheck 10° → 100.00% (stable)
- Recheck 15° → 96.36% (stable)
- Recheck 20° → 88.64% (stable)
