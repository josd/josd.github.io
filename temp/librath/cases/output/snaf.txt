Answer
------
Goal: (':Alice', ':hates', ':Nobody')
Result: PROVED
Bindings: {'?x': ':Bob'}

KB facts:
  :Alice :loves :Bob .
  :Bob a :Person .

Reason why
----------
We use scoped negation-as-failure on the *single* KB:
  ?SCOPE log:notIncludes { :Alice :hates ?x }  succeeds
  iff no triple in the KB matches (:Alice :hates ?x).
Since KB has no :hates triple for Alice, the test holds;
and we can instantiate ?x with a person (here :Bob) to fire the rule.

Proof trace:
Step 01: prove (':Alice', ':hates', ':Nobody')
→ via R-hates-nobody
  ✓ notIncludes (absent in KB)
  ✓ fact (':Bob', 'a', ':Person')

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: SNAF is correctly scoped to the single KB; success/failure conditions verified.
