→ Parsed 10 transition rules from the N3 block.

GPS (N3 rules) — Answer / Reason why / Check (harness)
============================================

Patient     : Jane Doe  (gender=Female, age=14)
Start state : state_2
Goal state  : state_6

Answer
======
No admissible path exists under the limits for this patient.

Reason why
==========
Global limits (identical to N3 query):
  duration ≤ 180 days, cost ≤ €500, success ≥ 0.35, comfort ≥ 0.35, stagecount ≤ 10

From the start state state_2, applicable rules for this patient: 0
  • None. Every rule with FROM=state_2 requires gender=Male (and sometimes age>18),
    but the patient is Female, 14. Therefore the search has no outgoing move,
    and no path can reach the goal.

Check (harness)
===============
• No-solution case confirmed for Jane Doe (Female, 14). ✓
• Positive sanity: John Doe has 1 solution(s). Best path ['take_pill_Medication_5'] reaches state_6 with succ=0.635, cost=€86, dur=1d, comf=0.760. ✓

Harness complete: parsing, applicability, limits, and search behavior verified. ✓
