Answer
======
All solutions to ?- isa(S, C):
  S = Socrates  C = Human
  S = Socrates  C = Mortal

Syllogism instance:
    ✓ rule: Socrates → Human → Mortal

Reason why
==========
We assume a single inference rule:
  subclass(A, B) & isa(S, A)  ⇒  isa(S, B)
With facts:
  isa(Socrates, Human)
  subclass(Human, Mortal)
Instantiating A=Human, B=Mortal, S=Socrates yields isa(Socrates, Mortal).

Check (harness)
===============
closure == solver ? True
contains expected {Socrates→Human, Socrates→Mortal} ? True
one-step justification for derived answers ? True
