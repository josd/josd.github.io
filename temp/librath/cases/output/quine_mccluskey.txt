Answer
======
Minterms: [1, 3, 7, 11, 15]
Don't-cares: [0, 2, 5]

Prime implicants (deterministic order):
  00--
  0--1
  --11

Selected minimal cover (lexicographically first): ['00--', '--11']
Minimal Sum-of-Products:
 f = ¬A¬B + CD

Reason why
==========
We run Quine–McCluskey with don't-cares:
  1) Group minterms+DCs by Hamming weight; combine adjacent groups across 1-bit
     differences to build larger implicants; anything never combined becomes a prime.
  2) Build a prime-implicant chart over *minterms only*.
  3) Take all essentials; for the remaining minterms, choose the smallest-size cover
     among nonessential primes. On ties, pick the lexicographically first by the
     key 0 < 1 < - (dash as greatest).
This yields a two-implicant cover equivalent to f.
