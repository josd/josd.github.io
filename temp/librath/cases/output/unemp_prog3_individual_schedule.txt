# REASONS
- Waiting week policy: first 1 week(s) unpaid.
- Payment day assumed: Friday (week_start + 4 days).

Wrote ./cases/bus/unemp/individual_schedules.json

# CHECK (harness) — detailed
Check 1 — Schedule length equals duration + waiting:
  - w1 expected=27, got=27
Check 2 — Waiting week has zero payment; others equal WBA:
Check 3 — Checklist present every week:
✔ All checks passed.
