Solutions to p_4(n) = n with 1 ≤ n ≤ 10000: [11]

All partitions of 11 into four positive integers (orderless):
1 + 1 + 1 + 8
1 + 1 + 2 + 7
1 + 1 + 3 + 6
1 + 1 + 4 + 5
1 + 2 + 2 + 6
1 + 2 + 3 + 5
1 + 2 + 4 + 4
1 + 3 + 3 + 4
2 + 2 + 2 + 5
2 + 2 + 3 + 4
2 + 3 + 3 + 3

Reason why
----------
We count p_k(n), the number of partitions of n into exactly k positive parts,
via the standard recurrence p_k(n) = p_k(n-k) + p_{k-1}(n-1) with p_0(0)=1.
We then test p_4(n) = n. For n=11 we enumerate all nondecreasing 4-tuples
summing to 11 and observe there are exactly 11 of them, matching p_4(11)=11.
