Answer
======
With priorities δ1>δ2 (prefer Quaker-default):
  Extension = ['D', 'Q', 'R']   ⇒ Nixon is a Dove.
With priorities δ2>δ1 (prefer Republican-default):
  Extension = ['H', 'Q', 'R']   ⇒ Nixon is a Hawk.

Reason why
==========
We have two applicable defaults whose conclusions (D vs H) conflict.
The priority order decides which conclusion survives:
  • δ1>δ2 — apply δ1 first (Q ⇒ D). Adding H would violate D∧H, so δ2 is blocked.
  • δ2>δ1 — apply δ2 first (R ⇒ H). Adding D would violate D∧H, so δ1 is blocked.

Trace with δ1>δ2:
  Step 01: apply δ1: Q ⇒ D
  Step 02: block  δ2 (adding 'H' would violate constraint)
  Step 03: block  δ1 (conclusion 'D' already present)
  Step 04: block  δ2 (adding 'H' would violate constraint)

Trace with δ2>δ1:
  Step 01: apply δ2: R ⇒ H
  Step 02: block  δ1 (adding 'D' would violate constraint)
  Step 03: block  δ2 (conclusion 'H' already present)
  Step 04: block  δ1 (adding 'D' would violate constraint)
