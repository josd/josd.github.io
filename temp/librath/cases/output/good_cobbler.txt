Answer
======
Witnesses for ∃x ∃y . good_at(x, y):
  x=_:x , y=:Cobbler

From _:x a (:good :Cobbler) we derived  _:x a :Cobbler ? True

Reason why
==========
We interpret the composite class (:good Y) as meaning “good-at(Y)”.
Thus, if some x satisfies  a(x, (:good Y))  (or  :is(x, (:good Y))),
we infer both  good_at(x, Y)  and  a(x, Y).
Crucially, we *do not* allow the converse: from  a(x, :Good)  and  a(x, Y)
we may NOT compose  a(x, (:good Y)). This matches the classic observation
behind the ‘good cobbler’ example: predicate conjunction does not license
the fused compound class automatically.

Check (harness)
===============
Witness exists for good_at(_, :Cobbler)? True
Decomposition to membership in :Cobbler derived? True
NO spurious a(y, (:good :Cobbler)) from Good∧Cobbler? True
NO spurious good_at(y, :Cobbler) from Good∧Cobbler?   True
Generalizes to other Y (e.g., :Baker)? True
Closure is idempotent (fixed point)? True

All checks passed? True
