Facts for specimen g1:
  (g1, Body, deep)
  (g1, Body, small)
  (g1, Handle, horizontal)
  (g1, Handle, vertical)
  (g1, Height, 100)

Shape: Chalice
  ✗ body bowl                      w=100
  ✓ body deep                      w=100
  ✓ handle horizontal              w=100
  ✗ handle up                      w=100
  ✗ foot flaring                   w=100
  ✗ height 150–200                 w=100
  → fired 200 / 600 = P=0.333

Shape: Aryballos
  ✗ body round                     w=200
  ✗ mouth disk                     w=100
  ✓ handle present                 w=50
  ✓ height 50–100                  w=100
  → fired 150 / 450 = P=0.333

Shape: Neck_amphora
  ✗ body oval                      w=100
  ✗ mouth thick                    w=100
  ✓ handle vertical                w=100
  ✗ neck offset                    w=100
  ✗ foot heavy                     w=100
  ✗ height >200                    w=100
  → fired 100 / 600 = P=0.167

Posterior probabilities (sorted):
  Chalice      : 0.333
  Aryballos    : 0.333
  Neck_amphora : 0.167

Reason why
----------
Each shape has a set of weighted rules Rᵢ with weights wᵢ.
We evaluate Rᵢ against the specimen facts; the fired weight is Σ wᵢ over satisfied rules.
The inductivity score is P = (fired weight) / (total weight for the shape).
Height predicates are existential over all Height facts to ensure monotonicity under added evidence.

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: arithmetic correct; expected base P’s verified; supportive facts increase P as expected.
All checks passed.
