# Answer
The most efficient pattern is **logarithmic** when we normalize to r(N)=R and reward uniform coverage.

# Reason Why (Deterministic normalized geometry with uniformity)
- logarithmic: silk=16.4413, spoke=1.0000, CV_gaps=1.9292, U=0.3414, score=0.064255
-      linear: silk=65.9734, spoke=1.0000, CV_gaps=0.0000, U=1.0000, score=0.047439
-   quadratic: silk=45.0819, spoke=1.0000, CV_gaps=0.5766, U=0.6343, score=0.043956
Ranking (higher score is better): logarithmic > linear > quadratic

# Check (Recompute deterministically to confirm stability)
-      linear: recheck score=0.047439
-   quadratic: recheck score=0.043956
- logarithmic: recheck score=0.064255
