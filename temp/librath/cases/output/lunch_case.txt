# Answer
Yes — Green Bowl at 12:15 (finish by 12:57; total 42 min; €14.50/person).

—— Context ——
Participants: Alice (vegetarian, €20.00) & Bob (omnivore, €18.00).
Breaks: Alice 12:00–13:00, Bob 12:15–13:15.
Constraints: price ≤ min(budgets); walk ≤ 10; wait ≤ 10; diet coverage required; fit within shared window AND opening hours.
Objective: minimize total time = 2*walk + wait + service; tie-break by earlier start, then by name.
Shared window: 12:15–13:00 (45 min).
Shared budget ceiling: €18.00.

# Reason Why
✗ Pasta Place: hard limits violated (walk 8 min / wait 12 min; limits are 10/10).
✗ Sushi Go: price €22.00 exceeds shared budget €18.00.
✓ Recommended: Green Bowl — minimal total time 42 min; start 12:15; price €14.50 ≤ €18.00; walk 6 min, wait 5 min within limits; menu covers diets; open 11:30–14:30; earliest start 12:15; total 42 min fits.
