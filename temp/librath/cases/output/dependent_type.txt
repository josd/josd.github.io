Answer
======
Good-types generated by Good : Profession → Type
  Cobbler ↦ GoodCobbler   (good_of=Cobbler)
  Physician ↦ GoodPhysician   (good_of=Physician)

Inferred ‘good’ professionals:
  • alice → GoodCobbler
  • bob → GoodPhysician

Reason why
==========
We treat Profession as a meta-type and define a dependent constructor
Good : Profession → Type that automatically yields GoodP for each P.
Then two domain rules identify when a professional counts as ‘good’:
  • Cobblers are good if they produce at least one shoe that is Excellent.
  • Physicians are good if they treat at least one case with outcome Recovered.
This mirrors the idea that ‘good-at(P)’ depends on P (not just ‘good’ ∧ P).

Check (harness)
===============
Good-types exist for every (and only) Profession? True
Each GoodP has good_of = P?                     True
Alice inferred as GoodCobbler?                 True
Bob inferred as GoodPhysician?                 True
No GoodCobbler without Excellent shoe?         True
No GoodPhysician without Recovered case?       True
Inference is idempotent on WORLD?              True
Any GoodP implies base profession P?           True

All checks passed? True
