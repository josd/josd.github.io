Grelling–Nelson (heterological) — explain and check
============================================

Definitions:
  Autological(w)  : the adjective w applies to itself.
  Heterological(w): not Autological(w).

Set h := "heterological".  Two constraints when talking about this very predicate:
  (D)  Het(h) = ¬Applies(h)                   # definition of heterological
  (S)  Applies(h) = Het(h)                    # 'heterological' applies to a word
                                               # exactly when that word is heterological

Reason why it explodes in classical logic:
  From (D) and (S) we get  Het(h) = ¬Applies(h)  and  Applies(h) = Het(h),
  hence  Het(h) = ¬Het(h).  No two-valued assignment satisfies that.  □

Philosophical upshot:
  As stated, the heterological notion self-destructs under plain self-application.
  To avoid the clash, you must restrict the schema or change the semantics.

Check (classical two-valued):
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no (h, a) satisfies (D) and (S).

Conclusion:
  The Grelling–Nelson heterological question reduces to h ≡ ¬h for h := Het('heterological').
  In classical logic this has no model — a clean example of an 'outer limit of reason.' □
