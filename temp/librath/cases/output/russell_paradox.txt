Russell’s Paradox — outer limits of naïve comprehension (classical logic)
============================================================

Setup:
  R := { x | x ∉ x }   (the set of all sets that do not contain themselves)
  Abbreviation: r := 'R ∈ R'

Naïve comprehension + classical reading yield:
  r ≡ ¬r

Answer:
  No classical truth-value assignment satisfies r ≡ ¬r.
  Under naïve comprehension and two-valued classical logic, r has no consistent value.

Reason why:
  • Assume r is True, i.e., R ∈ R.
  • By the definition of R = { x | x ∉ x }, membership in R requires ¬(R ∈ R).
  • So from r we infer ¬r. Contradiction (r ∧ ¬r).
  • In classical terms: r must be True to match ¬r, but ¬r is False by negation.

  • Assume r is False, i.e., R ∉ R.
  • But then R satisfies its own membership condition (x ∉ x), so R ∈ R.
  • So from ¬r we infer r. Contradiction (r ∧ ¬r).
  • In classical terms: r must be False to match ¬r, but ¬r is True by negation.

  Takeaway:
  Naïve comprehension overreaches; restricting it (as in ZF/ZFC) avoids the paradox.
  Without such restrictions, Russell’s construction marks an 'outer limit of reason' for this system.

Check (harness):
  Trying r ∈ {False, True} against the constraint (r == (not r))...
  ✓ Unsatisfiable: no assignment makes r ≡ ¬r true.

  Truth table for r and (r == (not r)):
    r      not r    (r == not r)
    False  True    False
    True   False   False

Conclusion:
  Russell’s construction forces r ≡ ¬r from naïve comprehension,
  so classical consistency fails — a precise 'outer limit of reason.' □
