Summary
-------
Total paths: 34
Distinct up to reversal: 17

Reason why
==========
We search depth-first with backtracking:
  • Fix a starting vertex s and extend a path one vertex at a time.
  • A candidate v is SAFE at position pos iff:
      – v is adjacent to the previous vertex; and
      – v hasn’t appeared earlier in the path.
  • When the path reaches length n (number of vertices), it is Hamiltonian.

To cross-check completeness, the harness also counts Hamiltonian paths
using an independent bitmask DP (Held–Karp style). Both counts must agree.

Check (harness)
===============
Adjacency is symmetric with zero diagonal? True
Every reported path is valid Hamiltonian? True
No duplicates in enumeration?            True
Reverse of each path is also enumerated?  True
Half as many paths up to reversal?        True
DP count equals enumerated total?         True (DP=34, enumerated=34)

All checks passed? True
