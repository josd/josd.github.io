Answer
------
Apéry's constant ζ(3) ≈ 1.202056903156

Reason Why
----------
We used a rapidly convergent alternating binomial series for ζ(3), summing
terms until the next term's magnitude fell below 1e-11.
By the alternating series test, the truncation error is ≤ that next-term bound.
Independently, we cross-checked with the plain 1/n^3 series using an integral tail bound,
which bounds ζ(3) inside a narrow interval [S_N + 1/(2(N+1)^2), S_N + 1/(2N^2)].

Check (harness)
---------------
Route A terms used: 15
Alternating tail bound (≤): 4.775E-12
Route B interval width: 1.110e-15
Route A estimate inside Route B interval: FAIL

Route B bracket for ζ(3)
Lower bound: 1.202056903160
Upper bound: 1.202056903160

Result: OK (with warnings)
