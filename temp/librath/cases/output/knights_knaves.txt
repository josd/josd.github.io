Answer
------
Total solutions found: 2
First (deterministic) solution:
  A: Knight
  B: Knave
  C: Knave
  D: Knight
  E: Knight
  F: Knight
  G: Knave
  H: Knight

Reason why
----------
A is a Knight and says: "B is a Knave."
  B is Knave → statement is true
B is a Knave and says: "C is a Knight."
  C is Knave → statement is false
C is a Knave and says: "D is a Knave."
  D is Knight → statement is false
D is a Knight and says: "E and F are of the same type."
  E=K, F=K → same? True → statement is true
E is a Knight and says: "G is a Knave."
  G is Knave → statement is true
F is a Knight and says: "I am a Knight."
  Self-referential: 'I am a Knight.'
  This imposes no constraint: Knight→true; Knave→false; both satisfy role == statement.
G is a Knave and says: "H is a Knave."
  H is Knight → statement is false
H is a Knight and says: "A is a Knight."
  A is Knight → statement is true

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: solutions validated; deterministic; chosen solution locally unique under single flips.
