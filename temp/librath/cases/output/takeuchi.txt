tak(14,7,0) = 7

Cache statistics:
  MAXN: 50  → table size (cells): 51³ = 132,651
  calls: 697   hits: 266   stores: 310   hit-rate: 38.2%

Reason why
----------
Definition (return-z variant):
  tak(x,y,z) = { z                         if x ≤ y
               { tak( tak(x-1,y,z),
                      tak(y-1,z,x),
                      tak(z-1,x,y) )        otherwise

The recurrence fan-outs rapidly, but overlapping subproblems abound.
Memoisation makes each distinct triple (x,y,z) compute at most once,
dramatically reducing the effective work and keeping recursion depth
within Python's default limits for the sizes we test here.

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: base-case holds over grid; memoised result matches reference on grid
