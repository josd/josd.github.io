Answer
------
:Fabian :believes { { ?x a :glitter } => { ?x :notNecessarilyA :gold } }
:northStar :notNecessarilyA :gold

Reason why
----------
• Meta-rule 1 (says→believes): from :Einstein :says φ we instantiate x=:Fabian and derive :Fabian :believes φ.
• Meta-rule 2 (says→assert): from :Einstein :says φ we admit φ into the KB.
• Here φ is a *rule* { ?x a :glitter } ⇒ { ?x :notNecessarilyA :gold }, which we then fire on :northStar a :glitter.

Pretty proof
------------
[1] Facts: :Einstein :says { { ?x a :glitter } => { ?x :notNecessarilyA :gold } }  ;  :northStar a :glitter
[2] Premise-Rule: { :Einstein :says ?phi } => { ?x :believes ?phi }  // says→believes (∀x)
[3] Premise-Rule: { :Einstein :says ?phi } => ?phi                 // says→assert
[4] Apply says→believes [2]: :Fabian :believes { { ?x a :glitter } => { ?x :notNecessarilyA :gold } }
[5] Apply says→assert [3]: Admitted rule: { ?x a :glitter } => { ?x :notNecessarilyA :gold }
[6] Apply asserted φ: :northStar :notNecessarilyA :gold  (from ?x a :glitter)

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: expected entailments present; rule firing matches glitter-facts; derivation deterministic; meta-rules required.
