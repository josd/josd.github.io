GPS (N3 rules) — Answer / Reason why / Check (harness)
============================================

Patient     : Jane Doe  (gender=Female, age=14)
Start state : state_2
Goal state  : state_6

Answer
======
✅  Found 1 solution path(s):

Solution #1
  Steps      : 1  (≤ 10)
  Duration   : 1 day(s)  (≤ 180)
  Cost       : 44.00          (≤ 500.0)
  Success P  : 0.374          (≥ 0.35)
  Comfort P  : 0.450       (≥ 0.35)
     1. take_pill_Medication_49
  Final state: state_6

Optimal by (succ↓, cost↑, dur↑): path = ['take_pill_Medication_49'], succ=0.374, cost=€44.00, dur=1d

Reason why
==========
Global limits (identical to N3 query):
  duration ≤ 180 days, cost ≤ €500, success ≥ 0.35, comfort ≥ 0.35, stagecount ≤ 10

From the start state state_2, applicable rules for this patient: 5
  • take_pill_Medication_16: state_2 → state_3  (+1d, +€69, ×succ 0.489, ×comf 0.632)
  • take_pill_Medication_33: state_2 → state_8  (+1d, +€69, ×succ 0.790, ×comf 0.758)
  • take_pill_Medication_49: state_2 → state_6  (+1d, +€44, ×succ 0.374, ×comf 0.450) (reaches goal)
  • take_pill_Medication_58: state_2 → state_10  (+1d, +€87, ×succ 0.690, ×comf 0.550)
  • take_pill_Medication_60: state_2 → state_5  (+1d, +€12, ×succ 0.723, ×comf 0.850)

Explanation:
  • The only applicable transition that *reaches the goal* in one step is
    action ‘take_pill_Medication_49’: state_2 → state_6.
  • Other applicable first steps (e.g. to state_3, state_8, state_10) do not lead
    to state_6 under the gender/age filters and global limits in subsequent steps;
    the solver explores them and finds no complete path.
