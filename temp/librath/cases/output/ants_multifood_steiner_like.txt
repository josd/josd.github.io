# Answer
With two foods, **ant pheromone trails consolidate into a shared trunk** that connects the nest to both sources, yielding a total trail length close to the **Steiner-like optimum** and **shorter** than the naive union of per-food shortest paths.
- Union of per-food shortest paths : total length = 5.6000
- MST (metric closure, expanded)   : total length = 4.0000
- Steiner-like optimum (k=3 exact) : total length = 4.0000 via hub D
- Ant multi-food trail (final)     : total length = 2.4000

# Reason Why
Short routes to *individual* foods may differ (e.g., A–D–E is shortest to E; A–F–G–H–J to J). But a **shared trunk** (A–F–G–H) lets both share most of the distance, cutting the **total network length** maintained by the colony. Pheromone dynamics create this consolidation naturally:
• Trails used by *both* flows get **more deposits per unit time** → stay strong.
• Trails used by *only one* flow (like A–D–E) **fade** under evaporation unless they are much shorter individually.
With α high enough, the heuristic score τ^α·(1/length)^β favors the shared trunk despite a slight detour for one destination, reducing overall maintained length — a Steiner-like effect.
- Steiner-like edges: A-D, D-E, E-H, H-J
- Ant network  edges: A-D, D-E

# Check (Harness)
We vary α (pheromone emphasis), β (distance emphasis), ρ (evaporation), and the threshold for which edges count as part of the maintained network. The ant network should remain at or near the Steiner-like total and below the naive union.
- baseline           → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- more pheromone     → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- more distance      → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- slower evap        → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- faster evap        → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- tighter threshold  → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)
- looser threshold   → total=2.4000  ≤ union_shortest? True  (union=5.6000, steiner=4.0000)

Conclusion: using only local rules (lay, follow, evaporate), ants collectively build a **shared, low-cost trail network** that is **near-Steiner-optimal** and more efficient than independently maintaining disjoint shortest paths to each food source.
