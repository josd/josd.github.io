Answer
------
Feigenbaum δ (delta) ≈ 4.669201905193

Reason Why
----------
We compute the main-cascade superstable parameters s_n by solving
f_r^{(2^n)}(1/2) = 1/2 in a tight interval right after s_{n-1}.
Each candidate root is validated to ensure its *minimal* period is exactly 2^n;
spurious roots from other windows are rejected. Then δ follows from
(s_n − s_{n−1}) / (s_{n+1} − s_n) with the last few values averaged.

Check (harness)
---------------
Monotonic s_n increasing: PASS
Gaps shrinking: PASS
Last 3 δ_n spread: 2.833e-06
Convergence: WARN

s_n (last 6) and δ_n
s_ 6 = 3.569795293749960
   δ_06 = 4.669157182729
s_ 7 = 3.569913465422333
   δ_07 = 4.669191001773
s_ 8 = 3.569938774233287
   δ_08 = 4.669199454875
s_ 9 = 3.569944194608064
   δ_09 = 4.669201221269
s_10 = 3.569945355486450
   δ_10 = 4.669200830447
s_11 = 3.569945604111092
   δ_11 = 4.669203663862
s_12 = 3.569945657358853

Result: OK (with warnings)
