Answer
======
All S such that isa(S, WITCH):
  S = GIRL

Proof for S = GIRL:

Step 01: prove WITCH(GIRL)
  → via R1_burns_woman_witch
 Step 02: prove BURNS(GIRL)
   → via R2_wood_burns
  Step 03: prove ISMADEOFWOOD(GIRL)
    → via R3_floats_wood
   Step 04: prove FLOATS(GIRL)
     → via R4_floats_sameweight
    Step 05: prove FLOATS(DUCK)
      ✓ fact
    Step 06: prove SAMEWEIGHT(DUCK, GIRL)
      ✓ fact
 Step 07: prove WOMAN(GIRL)
   ✓ fact
✔ PROVED


Reason why
==========
Chain of implications (one possible route):
  isa(DUCK, FLOATS)  &  sameweight(DUCK, GIRL)
    ⇒ (R4) isa(GIRL, FLOATS)
    ⇒ (R3) isa(GIRL, ISMADEOFWOOD)
    ⇒ (R2) isa(GIRL, BURNS)
  plus the fact isa(GIRL, WOMAN)
    ⇒ (R1) isa(GIRL, WITCH).
