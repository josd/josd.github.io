ANSWER
========================================================================
All positive integers n with n ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6).
First 20 solutions: [1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29, 31, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 55, 59]
========================================================================
REASON WHY
========================================================================
Use 1^2+...+n^2 = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6.
Dividing by n reduces the condition to (n+1)(2n+1)/6 ∈ ℤ ⇔ 6 | (n+1)(2n+1).
Parity: 2n+1 is odd, so need n+1 even ⇒ n is odd.
Modulo 3: (n+1)(2n+1) ≡ 0 (mod 3) iff n ≢ 0 (mod 3).
Hence n must be odd and not a multiple of 3 ⇔ n ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6).
Conversely, n ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6) → 6 | (n+1)(2n+1) → divisibility holds.
Conclusion: all such n are exactly those with n ≡ 1 or 5 (mod 6).

CHECK (HARNESS)
========================================================================
✓ Equivalence holds for all n ≤ 200000 (brute-force guard).
✓ No even n is a solution (parity argument confirmed).
✓ No multiple of 3 is a solution (mod 3 argument confirmed).
✓ Spot-checks match the theorem (solutions and non-solutions).
All checks PASSED ✅
