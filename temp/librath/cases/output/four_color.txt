Answer
------
Countries: 47   Edges: 83
Used colours: 4  (≤ 4)   Palette: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow

   Red: Croatia, Cyprus, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Malta, Monaco, North Macedonia, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey
 Green: Albania, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Lithuania, Moldova, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Serbia, United Kingdom, Vatican City
  Blue: Andorra, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Montenegro, Norway, Switzerland
Yellow: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Luxembourg, Slovenia, Ukraine

Reason why
----------
We use DSATUR (degree of saturation): iteratively pick the uncoloured
vertex with the largest number of DISTINCT neighbour colours; break ties
by highest degree; assign the smallest colour not used by its neighbours.
This greedy heuristic reliably finds a 4-colouring on planar maps; here
it colours all 47 states using ≤ 4 colours, respecting all land borders.

Check (harness)
---------------
OK: constraints respected, deterministic DSATUR, ≤ 4 colours, symmetric adjacency.
