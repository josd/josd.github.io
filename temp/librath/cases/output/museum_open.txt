Answer
------
(C) Op — The museum is open today.

Reason why
----------
From (P1) Wd ∨ We, exactly one case holds (exclusive & exhaustive).
• Case Weekday:  assume Wd. From (P2) Wd→Op, infer Op.
• Case Weekend:  assume We. From (P3) We→Op, infer Op.
Both cases yield Op, so Op holds unconditionally.  (∨-Elimination)

Check (harness)
---------------
Scanned 4 exclusive day-cases; 2 satisfy (P1)∧(P2)∧(P3).
All satisfying cases make Op True.  ∨-Elimination validated. ✓
