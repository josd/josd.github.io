Answer
------
For every n ≥ 1,  1^3 + 2^3 + ··· + n^3 = [ n(n+1)/2 ]^2.

Reason why
----------
Proof by induction on n:
• Base (n=1):  1^3 = 1 and [1·2/2]^2 = 1. True.
• Step: assume S(n) = 1^3+…+n^3 = [n(n+1)/2]^2. Then
    S(n+1) = S(n) + (n+1)^3
           = [n(n+1)/2]^2 + (n+1)^3
           = (n+1)^2 · ( n^2/4 + (n+1) )
           = (n+1)^2 · ( (n^2 + 4n + 4)/4 )
           = (n+1)^2 · ( (n+2)^2 / 4 )
           = [ (n+1)(n+2)/2 ]^2.
  Hence the identity holds for n+1. By induction, it holds for all n ≥ 1. □

Intuition:
  Let T_n = 1+2+···+n = n(n+1)/2 be the nth triangular number.
  The identity says ∑_{k=1}^n k^3 = (T_n)^2 — the square of a triangle of dots.
