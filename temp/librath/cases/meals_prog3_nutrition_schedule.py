P3 — Program 3: Nutrition Summary & Simple Cooking Schedule

Short story (header):
  With the list in hand, the family wants to check that the plan is balanced and doable.
  The task is to summarize nutrition per person and outline a quick prep schedule.

Overview:
  Consume meal_./cases/bus/meal/plan.json and ./cases/bus/meal/grocery_list.json; compute per-day calories/macros from recipe
  nutrition and confirm ingredients are covered by pantry + purchases. Also output a simple
  cooking order. Prints Answer/Reason/Check and writes ./cases/bus/meal/final_week_plan.json.

Run:
  python meals_prog3_nutrition_schedule.py --plan ./cases/bus/meal/meal_plan.json --groceries ./cases/bus/meal/grocery_list.json

### DATA
# minimal household profile

# simple prep steps per recipe id (for demo)
PREP_STEPS = {
    "r1": ["Boil pasta (10m)", "Heat sauce (5m)", "Combine (2m)"],
    "r2": ["Cook rice (15m)", "Stir‑fry veg (10m)"],
    "r3": ["Cook chicken (12m)", "Warm tortillas (2m)", "Assemble (5m)"],
    "r4": ["—"],  # excluded by dislikes in Program 1, kept for completeness
    "r5": ["Stir‑fry beef/broccoli (12m)", "Steam rice (15m)"],
