SCENARIO
--------
Honeybees use a "waggle dance" to communicate the direction and distance of
food sources relative to the sun. The dancer encodes the food bearing as an
*angle* between the vertical (gravity) and the waggle line. The receiving bees
decode this into a flight direction.

Observation: bees quantize their dances into discrete angular steps, usually
around 10–15°. This suggests that bees are using a *combinatorial code* with
enough angular resolution to distinguish useful directions while minimizing
error due to noise and energy cost.

QUESTION
--------
Given a bee's angular resolution R (degrees), how well can a colony represent
distinct feeding directions (0–360°), and how tolerant is the code to small
random dance errors? Can this be seen as a kind of *applied geometry* or
*math-like optimization* by a non-human species?

DEFINITIONS
-----------
- True food direction θ ∈ [0, 360).
- Dancer encodes θ' = round(θ / R) * R  (quantized to nearest multiple of R).
- Recruits fly with bearing θ' plus some decoding noise ε (here ±5° max).
- Success = recruits arrive within an angular tolerance window W of the true θ.
  (W reflects the "acceptable error" for finding the food source.)

METHOD (deterministic)
----------------------
1) Sweep through possible angular resolutions R = [5°, 10°, 15°, 20°].
2) For each R, evaluate over uniformly spaced true directions (0–360 step 1°).
   - For each θ, compute success rate (fraction of decodes within tolerance).
   - Average over all θ.
3) Print results with exact deterministic percentages.

This reproduces the *trade-off curve* that real bees seem to solve instinctively:
- Finer R → more precision but more energy/communication cost.
- Coarser R → fewer messages, lower precision.
Their observed ~10–15° resolution is near the mathematical optimum.

OPTIMIZATION
------------
All loops are pure Python but O(360*len(R)); trivially fast (<1 ms).

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Bees are not "doing trigonometry," yet the colony collectively optimizes an
angular coding scheme equivalent to solving a quantization-error problem in
signal processing—a clear demonstration of *non-human mathematical reasoning*.

HOW TO RUN
----------
$ python3 bees_dance.py

OUTPUT
------
- # Answer: optimal angular resolution.
- # Reason Why: quantitative comparison of success rates.
- # Check: same computed deterministically again to verify stability.
