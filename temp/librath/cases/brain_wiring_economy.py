TOPIC (plain language)
----------------------
Your brain has about 100 billion neurons and roughly 100,000 km of wiring (axons).
Building and maintaining all that wiring costs energy and space, yet information
must travel quickly enough for perception and action to stay coordinated.

Nature faces a tradeoff:
  • Long, direct connections → fast signals but costly volume and energy.
  • Shorter, indirect connections → cheap to build but slower communication.

The brain’s wiring layout — from local microcircuits to large-scale white matter —
follows a **“wiring economy” principle**: minimize total (distance × cost) while keeping
average signal delay below a useful bound.

We’ll model this tradeoff and show that the optimal layout obeys a **square-root law**
between connection length and importance (or “traffic weight”). That same rule explains
why the cortex folds: to place heavily communicating regions physically closer.

WHAT WE REPORT
--------------
We compare three layout strategies on a fixed set of regions and connection demands:
  1) Fully local (shortest distances only)
  2) Fully global (all-to-all, long connections)
  3) Balanced wiring-economy (optimized distances per communication weight)

We compute total wiring cost and average communication delay for each, showing that
the *balanced* configuration minimizes a combined objective
      J = α * mean_delay + β * total_wire_length
for realistic α/β ratios.

DETERMINISM
-----------
All positions and weights are fixed numerical grids. No randomness; the same numbers
appear every run.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
This model shows that the brain’s folded structure and modular organization are the
natural outcome of minimizing wiring cost while keeping communication fast — a real
example of “geometry doing computation.”
