TOPIC (plain language)
----------------------
Ant colonies don't just find a shortest path to one food source; they also build
**shared trail networks** that connect the nest to multiple sources using common
"highways." That looks like a **Steiner-like optimization**: minimize the *total
length* of trail needed to connect all terminals (nest + foods), even when that
means a *single* path to one food is slightly longer than its individual shortest
route (because sharing the trunk saves total length).

WHAT WE DO
----------
We use a small map with one Nest (A) and two Foods (E, J). There are:
- Two alternative routes to E: a short, private route (A–D–E), and a longer route via
  a junction (H) that can be shared with J.
- One route to J that naturally passes through the junction (A–F–G–H–J).

We compare:
  1) **Union of per-food shortest paths** (do each food separately, no sharing pressure).
  2) **MST on the metric closure of terminals** (a classic lower-bound/reference).
  3) **Steiner-like optimum for three terminals** (exact for k=3 by picking a best hub node).
  4) **Ant multi-food pheromone trails (deterministic)**: in each iteration, ants visit
     *both* foods; pheromone evaporates (ρ) and deposits ∝ 1/path_length. Score = τ^α · (1/length)^β.
     With sufficiently high α, the two flows consolidate into a shared trunk.

DETERMINISM
-----------
No randomness. Equal initial pheromone, fixed tie-breaking, fixed order of operations.

INTERPRETATION
--------------
Local “lay, follow, evaporate” rules yield a *global* network that’s nearly
Steiner-optimal: a **shared trunk** to H plus short leaves to E and J.
