## **Socrates and Yanofsky – Self-Knowledge as a Boundary**

Both the ancient Greek philosopher **Socrates** and the modern mathematician **Noson Yanofsky** are concerned, in very different ways, with the pursuit of **self-knowledge**. Surprisingly, their paths converge in a deep insight: true self-examination doesn’t lead to omniscience, but to an awareness of **limits**.

Socrates famously declared: *“Know yourself”* (*gnothi seauton*). For him, this was not just moral advice—it was the cornerstone of wisdom. But he also insisted, *“I know that I know nothing.”* This paradox reveals that honest self-knowledge leads not to mastery, but to **humility**: the recognition of how little we actually understand, even about ourselves.

Yanofsky, in his book *The Outer Limits of Reason*, explores similar territory, but within the realm of **logic, mathematics, and science**. He shows that any system that tries to fully understand itself—whether a logical theory, a computer program, or even scientific reasoning—runs into **paradoxes** and **unsolvable problems**. Think of Gödel’s incompleteness theorems: some truths within a system cannot be proven by the system itself. Or Turing’s Halting Problem: some questions simply can’t be answered by computation.

In both cases—Socratic introspection and formal self-reference—**self-knowledge reveals boundaries**. The deeper the attempt to grasp oneself, the more clearly the edges of understanding emerge.

Socrates reached this through **philosophical reflection**, while Yanofsky reaches it through **mathematical reasoning**. But the outcome is the same: **fundamental limits to what can be known about the self**, whether human or systemic.

So in the end, ancient wisdom and modern science meet at the same conclusion:

> **To know yourself is to know your limits.**
